Module exports are the instructions that tell Node. js which bits 
of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to export from a given 
file so that other files are allowed to access the exported code.
Every module can have two different types of exports.
Named Export and Default Export.

DEFAULT EXPORT AND NAMED EXPORT ?

Default Export :
Export defaults are used to export a single module, variable, expression, 
or function from a JavaScript file so that it can be used in any other 
file of either the same program or even in an entirely different program.

Named Export :
Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a 
single file Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must 
be imported using the name of the object, function or variable that was exported.
